numHeaderRows 1
caption Terminology
data
X/Y
Hybrid ARMs are often referred to in this format, where X is the number of years during which the initial interest rate applies prior to first adjustment (common terms are 3, 5, 7, and 10 years), and Y is the interval between adjustments (common terms are 1 for one year and 6 for six months). As an example, a 5/1 ARM means that the initial interest rate applies for five years (or 60 months, in terms of payments), after which the interest rate is adjusted annually. (Adjustments for escrow accounts, however, do not follow the 5/1 schedule; these are done annually.)
Fully Indexed Rate
The price of the ARM as calculated by adding Index + Margin = Fully Indexed Rate. This is the interest rate your loan would be at without a Start Rate (the introductory special rate for the initial fixed period). This means the loan would be higher if adjusting, typically, 1-3% higher than the fixed rate. Calculating this is important for ARM buyers, since it helps predict the future interest rate of the loan.
Margin
[Profit_margin|profit margin]
Index
[Libor|Libor]
Start Rate
The introductory rate provided to purchasers of ARM loans for the initial fixed interest period.
Period
The length of time between interest rate adjustments. In times of falling interest rates, a shorter period benefits the borrower. On the other hand, in times of rising interest rates, a shorter period benefits the lender.
Floor
A clause that sets the minimum rate for the interest rate of an ARM loan. Loans may come with a Start Rate = Floor feature, but this is primarily for Non-Conforming (aka Sub-Prime or Program Lending) loan products. This prevents an ARM loan from ever adjusting lower than the Start Rate. An "A Paper" loan typically has either no Floor or 2% below start.
Payment Shock
Industry term to describe the severe (unexpected or planned for by borrower) upward movement of mortgage loan interest rates and its effect on borrowers. This is the major risk of an ARM, as this can lead to severe financial hardship for the borrower.
Cap
Any clause that sets a limitation on the amount or frequency of rate changes.

1.0.0
2001 July 2
Initial release
1.0.5
2001 July 20
Several stability and performance improvements.
1.0.6
2001 July 24
The C code has been modified to use an altogether more reasonable library which doesn't abuse the C preprocessor. It should now work under Windows and Mac OS X.
2.0.2
2001 August 10
The UI has been rewritten to be very simple and easier to use.
2.1
2001 August 23
A fix for a serious problem which was keeping it from using a whole net connection, a complete rewrite of Downloader.py, and other minor tweaks.
2.2
2001 September 2
Several major changes were made to the protocol, which is now frozen.
2.3.1
2001 September 12
This release has extensive user feedback and download resuming.
2.5
2001 October 23
UI was rewritten. It is now completely graphical and works in mozilla/netscape under UNIX. Monothreading was added which gave vast performance increases. The publisher now stores metadata in files, so it doesn't have to re-scan files every time it restarts, and the tracker now stores publisher and downloader information persistently, so downloads start working again as soon as it restarts. A clean shutdown, small improvements, and bugfixes added.
2.6.1
2002 January 6
For this release, the upload/download logic was thoroughly rewritten to use a tit-for-tat bandwidth trading strategy. Usage of TCP buffering was also greatly improved. Unix installation was simplified, and many small improvements were added.
2.6.2
2002 March 18
The UI is much nicer, and now looks like a real GUI. There are a huge number of small stability and performance enhancements, none of them directly impacting the interface.
2.7
2002 April 29
Major performance enhancements, including peers reciprocating uploads more responsively. Significant UI enhancements were made, including progress meters on file allocation and resuming. Much better error-handling and multi-file support were added, so multiple files can be downloaded with a single click. The protocol has been reworked to be much more secure, and now uses a fixed port. This should be the last backwards-incompatible release. Several major bugs were also fixed.
2.7.1
2002 April 30
A massive bug in the last release has been fixed. That one barely worked at all; this one is much better.
2.7.2
2002 May 6
In this release, the tracker has been rewritten to use asynchronous I/O, so it no longer has the hanging problems which plagued it before.
2.8.0
2002 May 31
Huge internal performance improvements, changes to the protocol to substantially reduce overhead, and Tracker now keeps track of which peers are still up, greatly improving scaling.
2.8.1
2002 June 5
A crippling bug in the download logic has been fixed. It should scale comfortably to thousands of simultaneous downloaders now.
2.9
2002 July 2
This release contains major performance enhancements and bugfixes. The publication process has been greatly cleaned up and simplified. Deployments which have too many downloaders behind NAT can now keep them out with the tracker option, --nonat 1. This will hopefully be the last release with a version check on startup - if there are no big snags in the next deployment, the version check will be removed in the next release.
2.9.1
2002 July 4
Reporting of disk full and rejected by tracker has been fixed. Bitfields have been made big-endian for consistency.
2.9.6
2002 July 18
Fixed for all the tweaks and minor issues which showed up in the last trial run, and new support for building .debs.
3.0.1
2002 October 2
Minor cleanups, finalizing the protocol, and removal of version checking (which happened in release 3.0).
3.0.2
2002 November 5
A polished UI, improved upload and download rate estimation, a new GUI for making metainfo files, and some bugfixes.
3.1
2003 January 2
Massive performance improvements and some bugfixes were made. Some utilities were added. Upload rate capping was added.
3.2
2003 March 28
This release features massive performance improvements, and now supports read-only files. The Windows build now takes command-line parameters. There were also several bugfixes.
3.2.1b
2003 June 5
This version is enhanced with new features to make BitTorrent even more robust and easier to use.
3.3
2003 September 24
Files now only get allocated as they're downloaded, and don't fragment the hard drive. Large torrents no longer hose the CPU. Better network utilization and more consistent download rates have been achieved. Poorly seeded torrents now get out faster. Several important bugs were fixed.
3.4
2004 March 6
This version fixes bugs. The client no longer complains about tracker connection problems when transfers are still going. The bandwidth usage was reduced.
3.4.1
2004 March 11
This version fixes lots of bugs, adds more bandwidth savings, and improves support for peers behind dynamic IPs.
3.4.1a
2004 March 12
The tracker works under Python 2.2 and supports 3.3 clients properly. The client is unchanged.
3.4.2
2004 May 15
This release fixes some bugs (including an important tracker bug and a problem where some users got 'could not find file' messages) and adds warning message support, so trackers can send non-fatal human-readable messages to clients.

(up to 1/2 sec.) has now become available in the Creative Motion Picture mode. Only when the [EXPOSURE MODE] in the [MOTION PICTURE] mode menu is set to [M], and the focus mode dial is set to [MF].Please note that the shutter speed slower than 1/30 sec. can not be set, when the [REC MODE] in the [MOTION PICTURE] mode menu is set to [AVCHD], and [REC QUALITY] is set to [FHD] 3. Improved the stability of AF(Auto Focus) in Motion Picture recording. 4. Improved the stability of [AFC] operation in Focus mode. 5. Improved the performance of AWB (Auto White Balance). 6. Improved the S/N figure for the pictures taken with slow shutter speed. 7. Fixed the instability of operation when the lens is retracted into its barrel, using Olympus Imaging Corporation's M.ZUIKO DIGITAL ED 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 lens. 8. Fixed the instability of operation, using Olympus Imaging Corporation's M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 17mm f2.8 lens. 9. Improved the battery identification to assure the safety standards Panasonic uses for our customer's safety.

Elliptical
Features foot pedals that move in an elliptical, or ovular, motion as well as handles that allow a workout on the upper body.
Provides a total-body workout Tones muscle while improving cardiovascular health Less likely to cause stress to joints Pivoting, nonslip footpads fit around shoes for greater security Resistance and incline can be increased for a tougher workout
Exercise / Stationary Bike
A bike that's designed to be ridden in place. Generally features only a single wheel in the front.
Movable arms help provide a total-body workout Cushioned seats and pedal straps increase comfort and stability Solid or enclosed front wheels help prevent little hands and fingers from accidentally getting injured Design may be upright, recumbent or semi-recumbent
Rowing
Simulates the experience of rowing, placing equal emphasis on working out the upper and lower body.
Machines that fold take up less space when stored Low-impact workout helps minimize pressure on joints
Stair Stepper
Features two steps designed to simulate the experience of walking up stairs.
When proper posture is maintained, doesn't put strain on back Independent steps provide a better workout for both legs
Treadmill
Features a conveyor-style belt that rotates at varying speeds, providing a low-impact running workout indoors.
Various speeds allow for individually tailored workouts Inclines and interval training increase the variety of workout options "Continuous duty" rating is more important than "peak performance" when it comes to horsepower Safety keys help prevent accidents

data
[Price-earnings_ratio|P/E ratio]
Share price / Earnings per share (EPS) EPS is net income/weighted average no of shares in issue EPS may be adjusted to eliminate exceptional items (core EPS) and/or outstanding dilutive elements (fully diluted EPS)
Most commonly used equity multiple Data availability is high
EPS can be subject to differences in accounting policies and manipulation Unless adjusted, can be subject to one-off exceptional items Cannot be used if earnings are negative
Price / cash earnings
Share price / earnings per share plus depreciation amortization and changes in non-cash provisions
Cash earnings are a rough measure of cash flow Unaffected by differences in accounting for depreciation
Incomplete treatment of cash flow Usually used as a supplement to other measures if accounting differences are material
[P/B_ratio|Price / book ratio]
Share price / book value per share
Can be useful where assets are a core driver of earnings such as capital-intensive industries Most widely used in valuing financial companies, such as banks, which rely on a large asset base to generate profits
Book values for tangible assets are stated at historical cost, which is not a reliable indicator of economic value Book value for tangible assets can be significantly impacted by differences in accounting policies
[PEG_ratio|PEG ratio]
Prospective PE ratio / prospective average earnings growth
Most suitable when valuing high growth companies
Requires credible forecasts of growth Can understate the higher risk associated with many high-growth stocks
[Dividend_yield|Dividend yield]
Dividend per share / share price
Useful for comparing cash returns with types of investments Can be used to establish a floor price for a stock
Dependent on distribution policy of the company Yield to investor is subject to differences in taxation between jurisdictions Assumes the dividend is sustainable
Price / Sales
Share price / sales per share
Easy to calculate Can be applied to loss making firms Less susceptible to accounting differences than other measures
Mismatch between nominator and denominator in formula (EV/Sales is a more appropriate measure) Not used except in very broad, quick approximations

B-ON (Beyond CLDC)
B-ON serves as a very robust foundation for implementing embedded Java software. It specifies a reliable initialization phase of the Java device, and 3 kind of objects: immutable, immortal and regular (mortal) objects.
002
MicroUI
MicroUI defines an enhanced architecture to enable an open, third-party, application development environment for embedded HMI devices. Such devices typically have some form of display, some input sensors and potentially some sound rendering capabilities. This specification spans a potentially wide set of devices.
011
MWT
MWT defines three distinct roles: Widget Designers, Look and Feel Designers, and Application Designers. MWT allows a binary HMI application to run the same on all devices that provide a compliant MWT framework (embedded devices, cellphones, set-top box TV's, PC's, etc...) allowing for true consistency and ubiquity of applications across product lines (ME, SE, EE).

[Nickel-cadmium_battery|NiCd]
1.2
0.14
Inexpensive. High/low drain, moderate energy density. Can withstand very high discharge rates with virtually no loss of capacity. Moderate rate of self discharge. Environmental hazard due to Cadmium - use now virtually prohibited in Europe.
[Lead-acid_battery|Lead-acid]
2.1
0.14
Moderately expensive. Moderate energy density. Moderate rate of self discharge. Higher discharge rates result in considerable loss of capacity. Environmental hazard due to Lead. Common use - Automobile batteries

0.36
[Nickel-metal_hydride_battery|low self-discharge rate]
[Nickel-zinc_battery|NiZn]
1.6
0.36
Moderately inexpensive. High drain device suitable. Low self-discharge rate. Voltage closer to alkaline primary cells than other secondary cells. No toxic components. Newly introduced to the market (2009). Has not yet established a track record. Limited size availability.
[Silver-oxide_battery|AgZn]
1.86 1.5
0.46
Smaller volume than equivalent Li-ion. Extremely expensive due to silver. Very high energy density. Very high drain capable. For many years considered obsolete due to high silver prices. Cell suffers from oxidation if unused. Reactions are not fully understood. Terminal voltage very stable but suddenly drops to 1.5 volts at 70-80% charge (believed to be due to presence of both argentous and argentic oxide in positive plate - one is consumed first). Has been used in lieu of primary battery (moon buggy). Is being developed once again as a replacement for Li-ion.
[Lithium-ion_battery|Lithium ion]
3.6
0.46
Very expensive. Very high energy density. Not usually available in "common" battery sizes. Very common in laptop computers, moderate to high-end digital cameras, camcorders and cellphones. Very low rate of self discharge. Terminal voltage unstable (varies from 4.2 to 3.0 volts during discharge). Volatile: Chance of explosion if short circuited, allowed to overheat, or not manufactured with rigorous quality standards.

Figures for the population of Jains differ from just over six million to twelve million due to difficulties of Jain identity, with Jains in some areas counted as a Hindu sect. Many Jains do not return Jainism as their religion on census forms for various reasons such as certain Jain castes considering themselves both Hindu and Jain. Following a major advertising campaign urging Jains to register as such, the 1981 Census of India returned 3.19 million Jains. This was estimated at the time to still be half the true number. The 2001 Census of India had 8.4 million Jains.

Figures for the population of Jains differ from just over six million to twelve million due to difficulties of Jain identity, with Jains in some areas counted as a Hindu sect. Many Jains do not return Jainism as their religion on census forms for various reasons such as certain Jain castes considering themselves both Hindu and Jain. Following a major advertising campaign urging Jains to register as such, the 1981 Census of India returned 3.19 million Jains. This was estimated at the time to still be half the true number. The 2001 Census of India had 8.4 million Jains.

Incoming calls redirected to voice mail When incoming calls are redirected to voice mail, operators can charge for message recording as much as a sum of their tariffs for incoming calls and outgoing calls back to home country. Beginning on 1 July 2010 operators cannot charge their roaming customers for the receipt by them of a roaming voice mail message. Listening to such messages could still be charged as an outgoing call in the future.

Group I: muscle disorders Ia. Myofascial pain: Report of pain or ache in the jaw, temples, face, preauricular area, or inside the ear at rest or during function; Pain reported by the subject in response to palpation of 3 of the following muscle sites (right side and left side count as a separate sites for each muscle): posterior temporalis, middle temporalis, anterior temporalis, origin of masseter, insertion of masseter, posterior mandibular region, submandibular region, lateral pterygoid area, and tendon of the temporalis; At least one of the painful sites must be on the same side as the complaint of pain. Ib. Myofascial pain with limited opening: Myofascial pain as de?ned in Ia; Pain-free unassisted mandibular opening 40mm; Maximum assisted opening (passive stretch) 5mm greater than pain-free unassisted opening. Group II: disc displacements IIa. Disc displacement with reduction: Reciprocal clicking in TMJ (click on both vertical opening and closing that occurs at point 5mm greater interincisal distance on opening than closing and is eliminated on protrusive opening), reproducible on 2 out of 3 consecutive trials; or Clicking in TMJ on both vertical range of motion (either opening or closing), reproducible on 2 out of 3 consecutive trials, and click during lateral excursion or protrusion, reproducible on 2 out of 3 consecutive trials. IIb. Disc displacement without reduction with limited opening: History of signi?cant limitation in opening; Maximum unassisted opening 35mm; Passive stretch increases opening by 4mm over maximum unassisted opening; Contralateral excursion 7mm and/or uncorrected deviation to ipsilateral side on opening; Absence of joint sound or presence of joint sounds not meeting criteria for disc displacement with reduction. IIc. Disc displacement without reduction, without limited opening: History of signi?cant limitation of mandibular opening; Maximum unassisted opening 35mm; Passive stretch increases opening by 5mm over maximum unassisted opening; Contralateral excursion 7mm; Presence of joint sounds not meeting criteria for disc displacement with reduction; In those studies allowing images, imaging conducted by either arthrography or magnetic resonance reveals disc displacement without reduction. Group III: arthralgia, osteoarthritis, osteoarthrosis IIIa. Arthralgia: Pain in one or both joint sites (lateral pole and/or posterior attachment) during palpation; One or more of the following self-reports of pain: pain in the region of the joint, pain in the joint during maximum unassisted opening, pain in the joint during assisted opening, and pain in the joint during lateral excursion; For a diagnoses of simple arthralgia, coarse crepitus must be absent. IIIb. Osteoarthritis of the TMJ: Arthralgia as de?ned in IIIa; Either coarse crepitus in the joint or radiologic signs of arthrosis. IIIc. Osteoarthrosis of the TMJ: Absence of all signs of arthralgia; Either coarse crepitus in the joint or radiologic signs of arthrosis

After watching the presentations and tasting the dishes, the judges chose 9 contestants (Alex, Fran, Greg and Krystal, Jamawn, Joseph, Marisa, Sandy, Stephenie, and Sudhir) to compete for the opportunity to have their concept opened as a restaurant in three locations. Eric and Jason have a extra demonstration to determine who gets the last spot. Eric has to grill as many grill cheese sandwiches as he can and Jason has to make a great burger. With Eric making 29 in fifteen minutes and a merely satisfactory burger from Jason, the judges place Eric in the final spot.

They conclude that a Texan cowboy is actually Burnaise and Mr. Moseby orders Chef Paolo to cook a wonderful meal for him. Things take a turn for the worse when Chef Paolo quits after being insulted, and Cody must take over, having London, Maddie, and Zack as his kitchen staff. What they don't know is that although the cowboy is impressed with his meal, he is actually not the real food critic, who suddenly appears to give the Tipton another chance when he realizes the situation and the struggle to serve the cowboy. Chef Paolo then decides to go back to work at the Tipton, where his being in charge assures that the Tipton will get good reviews.
Mr. Moseby receives information that a food critic called Bernard Burnaise is coming to the Tipton to try out the food. He is told that Burnaise has three different disguises: A middle-aged woman, a Chinese man with a long beard, and a cowboy.

Zack and Cody try to save the Tipton's carriage horse (Tippy) from being sold to a mean lumberjack when the horse carriage driver Henry gets retired. London borrows Maddie's great grandma's brooch, but when she loses it, Maddie makes her feel bad. Mr. Moseby arranges a banquet with Mrs. Delecourt. The boys sneak Tippy into the hotel and have him stay with Arwin, but then Tippy escapes so the boys look all around the hotel. London tells Carey that the broach is in the trash but she's not looking there. But Carey tells her that a good friend would help look for it. So Arwin and London look for it in the dumpster and run into a homeless guy. At the end, Mrs. Delecourt convinces Mr. Tipton not to retire Henry, and the homeless man comes to the hotel with Maddie's brooch.

Zack and Cody are surprised by their aptitude test scores: Zack is told he will be a CEO, while Cody is going to turn out as a sanitation engineer (garbage man). Zack soon starts acting smart, while Cody starts to have a negative attitude. Meanwhile, Maddie saves the life of a Moroccan ambassador, and later London. She becomes famous for a little while and London doesn't like it. But eventually new news comes and Maddie is sad to find out that her 15 minutes of fame are over.

"Troubling News"
December29,2009
We are introduced to the Coles family. The first scenes show them feasting without inhibition before the camera, enjoying large meals of rich "comfort food" around the dining-room table. Then they visit a water park, hoping, Tameka says, to get some exercise. While there, after enjoying several rides and slides, they discover that they cannot ride a "tunnel" slide because they exceed the allowed weight (a combined 400 pounds for a minimum of two people). They console themselves with several servings of sugary funnel cake. At a doctor's appointment, accompanied by the family, Shayne learns some troubling news about his blood sugar: it is too high, and if he doesn't lose weight, he's told, he can expect to develop Type II diabetes.

At a doctor's appointment, accompanied by the family, Shayne learns some troubling news about his blood sugar: it is too high, and if he doesn't lose weight, he's told, he can expect to develop Type II diabetes.

"We Must Change"
December29,2009
Tameka and Shayne are anxious to start getting in shape, while Amber and Norris are not. Visits to the family's various doctors disclose that everyone is in danger of complications if he or she doesn't lose weight. Norris has a fit while Shayne throws away groceries that Norris just bought the day before. Everyone realizes that they all must start exercising and eating healthier.

"Yard Sale"
January5,2010
Tameka orders the family to gather up all their surplus junk for a yard sale. Tameka wants to price all the items cheap to sell fast; however, Norris wants to sell his items (which he bought at other yard sales in hopes of making a tidy profit) at higher prices. The night before the yard sale, Tameka shows how little she knows about "cooking healthy" when she must toss out a pan of skinless chicken breasts, then expects the family to dine solely on the broccoli she has boiled to go with it. Most of the broccoli goes uneaten. The next day, Norris drives customers away with his high-pressure sales tactics. One customer audaciously calls Shayne fat to his face; Tameka tells him off. The family does manage to collect more than a hundred dollars from the sale, and the items that did not sell are loaded up for donation to Goodwill.

"I Love You All Over Again"
January5,2010
Norris never proposed to Tameka because she was the one to give him an ultimatum when their children were already six and four years old: marry her or leave. So he married her. He always felt bad about not properly proposing to her. Norris asks his children to help him write out a proposal, and this inspires the kids to write a rap about how great their mother is. Norris and the kids surprise Tameka at a friend's house and she is reminded how much she is loved. Inadvertent comedy is supplied when Amber breaks her chair, but even Shayne empathizes instead of making fun of her.

"Camping"
January12,2010
The family decides to go on a camping trip, riding in an RV because it is a new experience and they aren't sure they're ready to "rough it" as such. Shayne brings his friend Tyler along with them; his slender size makes it obvious he's not one of the family. They prove to be unready to "rough it" when they begin the night outside, but the bugs and night sounds scare them back into the RV. Amber sprains her ankle climbing an artificial rock formation.

"Family Portrait"
January12,2010
Tameka, in charge as always, decides a family portrait is in order to show how far they've come in weight loss already and to show how much farther they'll have come later on. She and Amber go shopping for clothes for the picture and both mother and daughter are gratified to see that each has dropped several sizes. Shayne and his father need new clothes, too, and when they go shopping, Tameka goes along, ordering not just the fourteen-year-old but her husband to dress as Mama dictates. By the time of the actual trip to the photographer, the members of the family are barely speaking to each other, but ultimately the excursion goes well.

[Horse|Horse]
Can cover more ground quickly, but requires many to pull a heavy load, more likely to wander off. Despite what the Guidebook states, horses can survive on trail forage and do not require special feed. Their fast pace decreases the likelihood of sickness to your wagon party. They can be stolen, because they are attracted to thieves.
[Independence,_Missouri|Independence]
[Mule|Mule]
Stronger, but slightly slower than horses, least prone to disease, most tolerant to high temperatures, requires less hoof care, water, and they are stubborn.
In Independence and St. Joseph, $44.00. In Nauvoo and Council Blufs, $48.00
[Ox|Ox]
Strong, slow draft animal, highest endurance, most prone to sickness, most tolerant to cold weather, requires less to pull heavy loads compared to horses and mules, less likely to wander off and get lost. Because of their generally slow pace, the chance of party members getting sick or injured is also increased.
In Independence and St. Joseph, $11.00. In Nauvoo and Council Bluffs, $12.00
[Chicken|Chicken]
Provides fresh eggs for food or to trade, rides in cages tied to the wagon. Can be lost in accidents or stolen.
In Independence and St. Joseph, $2.95. In Nauvoo and Council Bluffs, $4.00
[Dairy_cattle|Milk cow]
Provides gallons of milk, and if the player has one or more butter churns, will also give fresh butter for food or to trade, can replace an ox as a draft animal, will cease to produce milk if worked too hard. Can be lost in accidents or stolen.
In Independence and St. Joseph, $55.00. In Nauvoo and Council Bluffs, $60.00
[Pig|Pig]
Has absolutely no purpose other than added points at the end of the game, although they can be slaughtered for meat. Can be lost in accidents or stolen.
In Independence and St. Joseph, $22.00. In Nauvoo and Council Bluffs, $24.00

[Androgen_receptor|AR]

5-DHT or DHT is a male reproductive hormone that targets the prostate gland, bulbourethral gland, seminal vesicles, penis and scrotum and promotes growth/mitosis/cell maturation and differentiation. Testosterone is converted to 5-DHT by 5alpha-reductase, usually with in the target tissues of 5-DHT because of the need for high concentrations of 5-dht to produced the physiological effects.

Bioidentical hormones fit precisely into human hormone receptors while conventional hormones fit "cockeyed"; this mismatch causes serious side effects

There is no evidence to support weight loss due to progesterone
"Normal" levels of progesterone protect against breast cancer
[Infertility|infertile]
[Cardiovascular_disease|cardiovascular disease]
The use of micronized progesterone does not affect cardiovascular risk
The side effects reported in the Women's Health Initiative study were due to the synthetic nature of the hormones used
"Cardiovascular benefit has not been proven with micronized progesterone in observational or experimental research...a multicenter, case-control study was conducted in postmenopausal women aged 45-70 years to examine potential differences in cardiovascular risk between the subtypes of synthetic progestins and micronized progesterone...Micronized progesterone and pregnane derivatives were not associated with an increased venous thromboembolism risk, whereas norpregnane derivatives...were associated with increased risk of thromboembolism...Thus, certain progestins are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, whereas pregnane derivatives and micronized progesterone neither increase nor decrease cardiovascular risk in the doses studied"
Proponents claim that bioidentical hormones, in addition to the demonstrated benefit of improving bone-mineral density, protecting the eyes and skin from drying out, regulating the menstrual cycle, improving mental function, improving blood cholesterol and reducing hot flashes and night sweats associated with menopause
There is no published evidence (derived from controlled research) supporting the claims of superior beneficial effects for bioidentical hormones as compared to conventional hormome therapy. Risk data have been published for conventional hormone therapy, and CHRT is not recommended to manage any chronic diseases, or for the prevention of cardiovascular disease
[Estriol|Estriol]
Estriol has been shown to cause breast cancer cell growth
Pharmacists use their expertise regarding bioidentical hormones to meet the needs of their clients and improve health outcomes
Compounding is a legitimate practice, but there is no evidence that clearly illustrates the benefits and risks of BHRT

data
Start-up time
Almost instantaneous; no mechanical components to prepare. May need a few milliseconds to come out of an automatic power-saving mode.
[Spin-up|spin-up]
[Random_access|Random access]
Typically under 0.1 ms. As data can be retrieved directly from various locations of the flash memory, access time is usually not a big performance bottleneck.
[Hard_disk_drive_performance_characteristics|wait for the data to rotate]
[Latency_(engineering)|latency]
[Amdahl's_law|Amdahl's law]
Much higher than SSDs. Read time is different for every different seek, since the location of the data on the disk and the location of the read-head make a difference.
Data transfer rate
SSD technology can deliver rather consistent read/write speed, but when lots of individual smaller blocks are accessed, performance is reduced. In consumer products the maximum transfer rate typically ranges from about 100MB/s to 600MB/s, depending on the disk. Enterprise market offers devices with multi-gigabyte per second throughput.
[Revolutions_per_minute|rpm]
Read performance
<span> citation needed</span> 
<span> citation needed</span> 
[File_system_fragmentation|Fragmentation]
There is limited benefit to reading data sequentially (beyond typical FS block sizes, say 4kB), making fragmentation negligible for SSDs. Defragmentation would cause wear by making additional writes of the NAND flash cells, which have a limited cycle life.
Files, particularly large ones, on HDDs usually become fragmented over time if frequently written; periodic defragmentation is required to maintain optimum performance.
[Noise_(acoustic)|Noise (acoustic)]
SSDs have no moving parts and therefore are basically silent, although electric noise from the circuits may occur.
[Disk_read-and-write_head|heads]
Temperature control
[Heat_sink|heat sink]
[Seagate_Technology|Seagate]
[Hard_disk_drive|environmental factors]
[Hard_disk_drive|shock]
Heads floating above rapidly rotating platters are susceptible to shock and vibration
Installation and mounting
Not sensitive to orientation, vibration, or shock. Usually no exposed circuitry.
<span> citation needed</span> 
[Magnetic_storage|magnetic fields]
[Electromagnetic_pulse|electromagnetic pulse]
Magnets or magnetic surges could in principle damage data, although the magnetic platters are usually well-shielded inside a metal case.
Weight and size
Solid state drives, essentially semiconductor memory devices mounted on a circuit board, are small and light in weight. However, for easy replacement, they often follow the same form factors as HDDs (3.5-inch, 2.5-inch or 1.8-inch). Such form factors typically weigh as much as their HDD counterparts, mostly due to the enclosure.
HDDs typically have the same form factor but may be heavier. This applies for 3.5-inch drives, which typically weigh around 700 grams.
[Reliability_engineering|Reliability]
Category:Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2011
[Wear_and_tear|wear and tear]
Secure writing limitations
[Encryption|encryption]
HDDs can overwrite data directly on the drive in any particular sector. However the drive's firmware may exchange damaged blocks with spare areas, so bits and pieces may still be present.
Cost per capacity
NAND flash SSDs have reached US$0.59 per GB
HDDs cost about US$0.05 per GB for 3.5-inch and $0.10 per GB for 2.5-inch drives
<span> needs update</span> 
<span> citation needed</span> 
<span> citation needed</span> 
Read/write performance symmetry
Less expensive SSDs typically have write speeds significantly lower than their read speeds. Higher performing SSDs have similar read and write speeds.
<span> citation needed</span> 
Free block availability and TRIM
[Trim_(computing)|Trim_(computing)]
HDDs are not affected by free blocks and do not benefit from TRIM
Power consumption
-
The lowest-power HDDs (1.8-inch size) can use as little as 0.35watts. 2.5-inch drives typically use 2 to 5 watts. The highest-performance 3.5-inch drives can use up to about 20 watts.

This is a traditional (at least from Ming dynasty) food that is made from glutinous rice paste that has been rolled into small balls, boiled, then put into a soup base. These are traditionally white in color like then ew moon and eaten during the first full moon after Chinese New Year and symbolize togetherness of family. They are also often pink, or a mixture of pink and white balls, because red is good luck in Chinesec ulture (but red dye added to the white results in pink). Sometimes savory or sweet stuffings (such as red bean paste) are added.

A sequence of capture must give the maximum "value" to the capture, and a king (called a wolf) has a value of less than two men but more than one man. If a sequence with a capturing wolf and a sequence with a capturing man have the same value, the wolf must capture. The main difference with the other games is that the captures can be made diagonally, but also straight forward and sideways.
Played in Netherlands.

Thomas Dolby
Set in a dystopian dieselpunk past, a global cataclysm has left the world's inhabitants suffering from amnesia and struggling to move north to the "Floating City" to escape the rising temperatures.
Players worked cooperatively and competitively as tribes to collect items, make inventions, solve a mystery, and move north. The game was unique in that the inventory was all based on lyrics from Dolby's back-catalog and (at the time) upcoming album of the same name. The winning coalition of tribes received a private concert as a prize.

Remarked, "Google TV feels like an incomplete jumble of good ideas only half-realized, an unoptimized box of possibility that suffers under the weight of its own ambition and seemingly rushed holiday deadline."

Commentators were saying "Google TV is sinking" and that it was "on its last legs" as launch partner Logitech slashed the price of its Revue (from $249 to $99) to clear unsold inventory.

Some of the same commentators praised Google TV 2.0 as having a "brilliant interface" but still lacking "substance." Said "The latest Google TV, referred to as Google TV 2.0 throughout the rest of this review, is a star performer. It runs like a champ and it's clear that Google engineers paid close attention to criticism of version 1.0."

It says: "The advantage of the Google experience is that much of what is going on is happening online - as you're accessing video, photos, looking at stuff that is not just locally based." The LG 55G2 product was rated in general as excellent.

"Vizio's $99 launch price is a big improvement .... Unfortunately the software, which runs atop the antiquated Android Honeycomb release, is no better than before."

It says: "Overall, Vizio's Co-Star device will please most consumers and Vizio's made a really nice device, considering this is their first entry into the $99 streaming box market."
