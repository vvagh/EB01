Availability of AF performance in FHD (full HD) movie recording mode with Four Thirds lenses that are compatible with contrast AF. 3. Improved AF performance in movie recording with LEICA DG MACRO-ELMARIT 45mm / F2.8 ASPH. / MEGA O.I.S. (H-ES045). 4. Improved modulation accuracy of flash. 5. Improved AF (auto focus) performance with lenses of other manufacturer. 1. Improved Auto Focus performance for the subject in low contrast. 2. Decreased the operation noise of Auto Focus in Motion Picture recording for H-H020 lens. (In order to minimize the operation noise of Auto Focus, the Auto Focus operation speed is reduced in Motion Picture recording.) 3. Improved the stability of AE(Auto Exposure) control for H-ES045 lens(to be introduced in Oct., 2009). 1. Burst speed has become faster. Only when the [BURST RATE] in the [REC] mode menu is set to [H], Burst speed was increased from 3 pictures/second to 3.5 pictures/second. 2. Shutter speed slower than 1/30 sec. (up to 1/2 sec.) has now become available in the Creative Motion Picture mode. Only when the [EXPOSURE MODE] in the [MOTION PICTURE] mode menu is set to [M], and the focus mode dial is set to [MF].Please note that the shutter speed slower than 1/30 sec. can not be set, when the [REC MODE] in the [MOTION PICTURE] mode menu is set to [AVCHD], and [REC QUALITY] is set to [FHD] 3. Improved the stability of AF(Auto Focus) in Motion Picture recording. 4. Improved the stability of [AFC] operation in Focus mode. 5. Improved the performance of AWB (Auto White Balance). 6. Improved the S/N figure for the pictures taken with slow shutter speed. 7. Fixed the instability of operation when the lens is retracted into its barrel, using Olympus Imaging Corporation's M.ZUIKO DIGITAL ED 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 lens. 8. Fixed the instability of operation, using Olympus Imaging Corporation's M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 17mm f2.8 lens. 9. Improved the battery identification to assure the safety standards Panasonic uses for our customer's safety.

Mr. Moseby then hires Zack and Cody to sneak around the hotel and find out who exactly is Burnaise. They conclude that a Texan cowboy is actually Burnaise and Mr. Moseby orders Chef Paolo to cook a wonderful meal for him.
